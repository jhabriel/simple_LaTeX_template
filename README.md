# simple_LaTeX_template
A simple LaTeX template for writing preprints.

## Why?
Very often, when we write an article using a dedicated journal template, it is not always possible to submit the manuscript to pre-print servers due to copyright restrictions. This template offers a minimal set of necessary components to ease the migration of your manuscript to a "blank" LaTeX project.

## Who?
Anyone can use this template. However, the format is heavily biased towards mathematically-oriented articles.

## How?
Simply download or clone the repository, and start editing. If you use Overleaf, you can fork the repository and start a new project using the `Import from Github` option.

## Suggestions, troubles, and issues.
If you have suggestions or something is not working as expected. Please, create an issue.
